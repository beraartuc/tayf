adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- PTY-based shell wrapper that spawns the user's shell inside a pseudo-terminal
  and pipes output through a regex-driven rule engine.
- Eight built-in patterns: IPv4, IPv6, MAC, log level, HTTP status, FQDN,
  duration metric, and filename extension (curated catalog covering archives,
  source code, configuration, documents, media, and binaries).
- Shell discovery cascade: `$SHELL` → `/etc/passwd` (`getpwuid`) → `/bin/sh`,
  with `--shell <path>` and `--login` overrides.
- CLI flags: `--shell`, `--login`, `--no-color`, `--help`, `--version`.
- Build-time SHA and rustc version surfaced via `--version`.
- `TAYF_LOG` environment variable activates `tracing-subscriber` diagnostics on
  stderr (off by default).
- 5-state DEC private mode parser detects TUI modes (alt-screen
  `\x1b[?1049h` and legacy variants `47`/`1047`, bracketed paste `2004`,
  mouse tracking `1000`/`1002`/`1003`/`1006`) and switches the pipeline to
  passthrough so vim, less, htop, neovim, Claude Code, lazygit, k9s, gum,
  bubbletea-based tools, and similar TUIs render unaltered.
- 64 KB hard-capped, UTF-8-safe line buffer.
- Raw-mode termios RAII guard with panic-hook fallback so the terminal is
  restored on any exit path.
- Signal handling thread (signal_hook): `SIGWINCH` resizes the PTY, `SIGINT`
  and `SIGTERM` are forwarded to the child process group with `killpg`.
- Exit-code propagation from the child shell; OS-error and software-error
  codes per BSD sysexits when tayf itself fails.
- Automatic colorization bypass when stdout is not a TTY.

### Security

- All built-in patterns are linear-time (verified by inspection); no
  catastrophic backtracking.
- Line buffer is hard-capped to bound memory under adversarial output.
- ANSI emission is restricted to SGR sequences by a single audited function
  (`Style::to_sgr`) with a unit test asserting the output grammar.
- Shell is spawned via `argv`-style `CommandBuilder`, never via `sh -c`.
